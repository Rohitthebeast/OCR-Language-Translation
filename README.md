# OCR-Language-Translation
Train an end-to-end system to translate text in images (e.g. photos of street signs, menus, museum plaques) to/from Arabic and English. 
The code provided obtains the boxed region by the OCR and blurs it, providing the JSON Output for it as well. This can be seen in the example output.
